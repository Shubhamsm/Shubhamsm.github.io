### Case Concerning Right of Passage Over Indian Territory (Portugal v. India)

#### Overview

**Court**: International Court of Justice (ICJ)  
**Year**: 1960  
**Parties**: Portugal (Applicant) vs. India (Respondent)

#### Facts of the Case

- **Background**:
  - Portugal held sovereignty over two enclaves, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, which were surrounded by Indian territory.
  - Portugal claimed the right of passage to exercise its administrative functions and transport goods and personnel between its coastal territories of Goa, Daman, and Diu, and the enclaves.

- **Dispute**:
  - In 1954, the local inhabitants of Dadra and Nagar Haveli revolted and expelled the Portuguese authorities.
  - Subsequently, India took control of the enclaves, and Portugal was denied passage through Indian territory to these areas.

- **Claims**:
  - Portugal claimed it had a right of passage for administrative purposes over Indian territory based on historical treaties, agreements, and practices.
  - India contested this claim, arguing that any such rights were extinguished with the end of colonial rule and that Portugal's actions were inconsistent with India's sovereignty.

#### Legal Issues

1. **Right of Passage**: Whether Portugal had a customary right of passage for civil and military purposes over Indian territory to access its enclaves.
2. **Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity**: The balance between Portugal's claims of right of passage and India's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

#### Court's Decision

The International Court of Justice ruled in favor of India.

#### Key Points of the Judgment

1. **Customary International Law**:
   - The Court examined historical treaties, agreements, and practices to determine if Portugal had established a customary right of passage.
   - The ICJ found that while Portugal had a historical right of passage for certain purposes, this right was limited to civil (non-military) traffic and was not absolute.

2. **Right of Passage for Civil Purposes**:
   - The Court recognized that Portugal had a right of passage for civil purposes based on historical usage.
   - However, this right was subject to Indian sovereignty and could be regulated by India.

3. **Military Passage**:
   - The ICJ rejected Portugal's claim to a right of passage for military purposes, finding no basis in historical treaties or practice for such a right.

4. **Regulation by India**:
   - The Court held that India had the right to regulate passage to ensure its security and public order, provided such regulation was reasonable and did not effectively nullify Portugal's right of passage for civil purposes.

5. **Territorial Sovereignty**:
   - The judgment emphasized the importance of territorial sovereignty and the principle that one state cannot exercise rights within the territory of another without that state's consent.

#### Conclusion

The case highlighted the complexities of historical treaties and customary international law in the context of decolonization and state sovereignty. The ICJ's decision affirmed India's sovereignty while recognizing a limited right of passage for Portugal, demonstrating the balance between respecting historical rights and upholding the territorial integrity of states.

#### Significance

- The judgment clarified the scope and limitations of rights of passage under international law.
- It reinforced the principle that historical rights must be balanced against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of modern states.
- The case is often cited in discussions on the intersection of customary international law, treaties, and state sovereignty.
