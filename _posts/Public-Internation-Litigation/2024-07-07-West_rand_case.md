### West Rand Central Gold Mining Co. Ltd v The King [1905] 2 KB 391

#### Case Synopsis

**Court**: King's Bench Division  
**Year**: 1905  
**Judges**: Lord Alverstone C.J., Wills J., Kennedy J.  

#### Facts of the Case

- The West Rand Central Gold Mining Company (the plaintiff) claimed that gold had been wrongfully seized by the British authorities during the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902).
- The gold had been taken from the company by the Boers in 1899, and the British subsequently took control of the area and annexed the Transvaal.
- The company argued that the British government was responsible for compensating them for the seized gold under international law, as the British had assumed sovereignty over the Transvaal.

#### Legal Issues

1. **Sovereignty and International Law**: Whether the British government was liable for the actions taken by the former Boer government before the annexation.
2. **Principle of State Succession**: Whether the successor state (Britain) inherited obligations and liabilities incurred by the predecessor state (Boer government).

#### Court's Decision

The King's Bench Division ruled in favor of the defendant (The King), rejecting the plaintiff's claim for compensation.

#### Key Points of the Judgment

1. **State Succession and Liabilities**:
   - The court held that, generally, international law does not impose an obligation on a conquering state to assume liabilities incurred by the predecessor state unless explicitly agreed upon in a treaty.
   - There was no treaty or agreement in this case that indicated Britain had accepted such liabilities from the Boers.

2. **Non-Justiciability**:
   - The court also ruled that certain aspects of international law, particularly those relating to state succession and sovereignty, are not justiciable in domestic courts unless they are incorporated into domestic law.

3. **Act of State Doctrine**:
   - The judgment highlighted the act of state doctrine, where the courts do not have the jurisdiction to question the actions of a sovereign state taken in the course of its governance.

#### Conclusion

The case established the principle that, in the absence of a specific agreement or treaty, a new sovereign power (in this case, the British government) is not automatically responsible for the liabilities of the territory it has annexed. This case is often cited in discussions of state succession and the limits of applying international law in domestic courts.
