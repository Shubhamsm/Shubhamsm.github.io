### Re Meunier's Case

**Case**: Re Meunier  
**Jurisdiction**: France to England  
**Year**: 1894  

#### Facts of the Case

- **Background**:
  - A French anarchist named Meunier was involved in bomb explosions in Paris, specifically targeting buildings, resulting in significant damage and public alarm.
  - After the incidents, Meunier fled to England to escape prosecution in France.

- **Extradition Request**:
  - The French government requested Meunier’s extradition from England to face charges related to the bombings, arguing that he was a criminal fugitive.

#### Legal Issues

1. **Extradition and Political Offenses**:
   - Meunier argued that his acts were political offenses, and under the doctrine of non-extradition for political offenses, he should not be extradited.

#### Court's Decision

- **Decision**:
  - The English court decided in favor of extradition. The court determined that the nature of Meunier's actions did not fall under the political offense exception. The bombings were considered acts of terrorism and criminal offenses, not protected as political acts.

- **Reasoning**:
  - The court distinguished between ordinary crimes and political offenses, concluding that bomb explosions targeting public safety and property could not be justified as political acts. Thus, Meunier’s acts were extraditable offenses.

#### Significance

- The case set a precedent in defining the scope of political offenses in extradition law.
- It clarified that acts of terrorism and violent crimes targeting civilians and public order are not protected under the political offense exception.

### Re Castioni's Case

**Case**: Re Castioni  
**Jurisdiction**: Switzerland to England  
**Year**: 1891  

#### Facts of the Case

- **Background**:
  - Castioni was involved in a political disturbance in Ticino, Switzerland, which resulted in the death of a government official during an uprising.
  - Castioni fled to England following the incident.

- **Extradition Request**:
  - The Swiss government requested Castioni’s extradition to face charges of murder and other crimes related to the political uprising.

#### Legal Issues

1. **Extradition and Political Offenses**:
   - Castioni argued that his actions were part of a political uprising and therefore qualified as political offenses, making him ineligible for extradition.

#### Court's Decision

- **Decision**:
  - The English court ruled against extradition. The court determined that Castioni's acts were political offenses and thus fell under the protection of the political offense exception in extradition law.

- **Reasoning**:
  - The court emphasized that the killing occurred in the context of a political uprising aimed at achieving political change. Since the offense was directly connected to the political disturbance, it qualified as a political offense.

#### Significance

- The case helped to delineate the parameters of the political offense exception in extradition law.
- It established that acts committed during genuine political uprisings, aimed at changing the political status quo, could be considered political offenses and thus protected from extradition.

### Summary

- **Re Meunier's Case**: The English court decided that violent acts of terrorism, such as bombings, are not considered political offenses and are extraditable.
- **Re Castioni's Case**: The English court ruled that acts committed during a political uprising, aimed at political change, could be considered political offenses and thus protected from extradition.

Both cases significantly contributed to the development of extradition law by clarifying the distinction between political offenses and ordinary criminal acts.
