### Naulilaa Incident Case (Portugal v. Germany)

#### Overview

**Court**: Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)  
**Year**: 1928  

The Naulilaa Incident refers to a case arising from a series of events during World War I, involving a conflict between Portugal and Germany. The case was significant in international law, particularly in the context of state responsibility and the use of force.

#### Facts of the Case

1. **Incident Background**:
   - In October 1914, during World War I, a conflict occurred between German and Portuguese forces at Naulilaa, a location in Portuguese Angola.
   - The conflict was triggered by a misunderstanding: German forces had entered Portuguese territory in search of provisions and were mistakenly attacked by Portuguese troops, leading to the death of three German officers.

2. **German Retaliation**:
   - In retaliation for the deaths, German forces launched a military expedition from neighboring German South West Africa (now Namibia) into Portuguese Angola, destroying several Portuguese outposts and causing significant damage and casualties.

3. **Claims for Compensation**:
   - Portugal claimed that the German retaliation was unjustified and disproportionate, and demanded compensation for the damages caused by the German attacks.
   - Germany argued that its actions were justified as an act of reprisal in response to the killing of its officers.

#### Legal Issues

1. **Legality of Reprisals**: Whether Germany's military actions in retaliation for the death of its officers constituted lawful reprisals under international law.
2. **Proportionality and Necessity**: Whether the German actions were proportionate and necessary in response to the initial incident.

#### Court's Decision

The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of Portugal.

#### Key Points of the Judgment

1. **Definition of Reprisals**:
   - The court distinguished between lawful reprisals and unlawful acts of war. Reprisals must be proportionate, necessary, and a last resort after other means of redress have been exhausted.
   - The German actions were deemed excessive and not proportionate to the initial incident.

2. **Proportionality**:
   - The court emphasized the principle of proportionality in international law. The scale and intensity of the German retaliation far exceeded what was necessary to address the initial wrong.
   - The destruction caused by Germany's military expedition was found to be disproportionate to the deaths of three officers.

3. **Necessity and Exhaustion of Peaceful Remedies**:
   - The court held that Germany had not exhausted peaceful means of resolving the dispute before resorting to military force.
   - Legitimate reprisals should only be taken after diplomatic channels and other peaceful remedies have been tried and failed.

4. **Compensation**:
   - The court ordered Germany to compensate Portugal for the damages resulting from the unlawful military actions.

#### Conclusion

The Naulilaa Incident Case is a landmark in international law, particularly regarding the principles governing reprisals and the use of force. The decision underscored the importance of proportionality, necessity, and the exhaustion of peaceful remedies before resorting to military action. The case set a precedent for the lawful conduct of reprisals and the responsibilities of states in international conflicts.
