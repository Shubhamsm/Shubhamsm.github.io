### Asylum Case (Colombia v. Peru) [1950] ICJ 6

**Court**: International Court of Justice (ICJ)  
**Year**: 1950  
**Parties**: Republic of Colombia (Applicant) vs. Republic of Peru (Respondent)

#### Facts of the Case

- **Incident**: On October 3, 1948, Victor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre, a prominent Peruvian politician and leader of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA), sought asylum in the Colombian Embassy in Lima, Peru, following a failed coup attempt.
- **Diplomatic Asylum**: Colombia granted Haya de la Torre asylum and requested safe passage for him to leave Peru. Peru refused, arguing that Haya de la Torre was not a political offender but was accused of common crimes, specifically military rebellion and other related charges.
- **Treaty Reference**: The dispute involved the interpretation of the Havana Convention on Asylum of 1928 and the Montevideo Convention on Political Asylum of 1933, both of which pertain to the rights and obligations concerning asylum and the treatment of political refugees.

#### Legal Issues

1. **Right to Grant Asylum**: Whether Colombia had the right to unilaterally qualify Haya de la Torre as a political refugee and grant him asylum without Peru's consent.
2. **Obligation to Provide Safe Passage**: Whether Peru was obligated under international law to grant safe passage for Haya de la Torre to leave the country.

#### Court's Decision

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in favor of Peru.

#### Key Points of the Judgment

1. **Qualification of Political Offender**:
   - The ICJ held that Colombia did not have the unilateral right to determine Haya de la Torre's status as a political offender without Peru's agreement. The Court emphasized that the right to grant asylum and to qualify an individual as a political refugee is not absolute and must be recognized by the territorial state (Peru).
   - The Court stated that diplomatic asylum should not be used to shield individuals from prosecution for common crimes, thus limiting the scope of unilateral qualifications of political offenders by the asylum-granting state.

2. **Safe Passage**:
   - The ICJ concluded that Peru was not obligated under international law to grant safe passage for Haya de la Torre. The Court noted that while diplomatic asylum has a traditional presence in Latin America, it does not constitute a binding customary international law obligation for the territorial state.
   - The Court clarified that the treaties in question (Havana and Montevideo Conventions) did not explicitly require the granting of safe passage, nor did they obligate the territorial state to recognize the asylum unconditionally.

3. **Treaty Interpretation**:
   - The ICJ analyzed the relevant provisions of the Havana and Montevideo Conventions and found that these treaties did not confer an unqualified right on the asylum-granting state to determine the status of the asylum seeker.
   - The Court highlighted that the conventions allowed for diplomatic asylum but within the constraints of mutual recognition and respect for the territorial state's sovereignty.

#### Conclusion

The Asylum Case clarified key aspects of international law regarding diplomatic asylum, particularly in Latin America. The decision reinforced the principle that the right to grant asylum and the qualification of an individual as a political offender require mutual recognition between the asylum-granting state and the territorial state. The ruling underscored the limitations of diplomatic asylum in protecting individuals accused of common crimes and emphasized the importance of state sovereignty in such matters.
